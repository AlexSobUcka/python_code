The joint angles to realize the verification set were
calculated based on the calibrated model, and they were
positioned by a robot controller. Note that, this calculation of
inverse kinematics is not solved analytically, so it should be
numerically solved, since the adjacent joint axes in the
calibrated model are no longer accurately parallel or
perpendicular to each other.
